# TweakInfoBot

[/u/TweakInfoBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/TweakInfoBot) on Reddit

Inspiration for this bot came from [/u/hearthscan-bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/hearthscan-bot) and [/u/Healdb](https://www.reddit.com/user/healdb) who made [/r/tweakinfo](https://www.reddit.com/r/tweakinfo/).

This Reddit bot runs on /r/jailbreak and /r/iOSthemes and looks for tweak and theme queries and returns information about those things.

Hosted on Heroku, major decisions in how this bot works are with the intention of having the bot run at no cost to me.
