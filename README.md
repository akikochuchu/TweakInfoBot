# TweakInfoBot

[/u/TweakInfoBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/TweakInfoBot) on Reddit

This Reddit bot runs on /r/jailbreak and /r/iOSthemes and looks for tweak and theme queries and returns information about those things.

Hosted on Heroku, major decisions in how this bot works are with the intention of having the bot run at no cost to me.

# Features

1. Checks posts and comments
2. Returns direct Cydia link, repo, cost, type, and short description

# Planned Features

1. Reply to PMs
2. Work with non-default repositories
3. Better tweak name recognition (account for spelling errors, etc)
